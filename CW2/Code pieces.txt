Certainly! Let's explore how to vectorize your tokenized word list using both **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)** in Python:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - **Step 1**: Initialize the TF-IDF vectorizer.
   - **Step 2**: Fit and transform the tokenized words using the vectorizer.
   - **Step 3**: Obtain the TF-IDF matrix, where each row corresponds to a document (or sentence) and each column represents a word.
   - Here's an example using your tokenized words:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Example tokenized words (replace with your actual tokenized words)
tokenized_words = [
    ["cat", "chase", "mouse"],
    ["dog", "bark", "tree"],
    ["bird", "fly", "sky"]
]

# Initialize the TF-IDF vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the tokenized words
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform([" ".join(words) for words in tokenized_words])

# Print the TF-IDF matrix
print("TF-IDF Matrix:")
print(tfidf_matrix.toarray())
```

2. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)**:
   - **Step 1**: Initialize a Word2Vec model.
   - **Step 2**: Train the model on your tokenized words.
   - **Step 3**: Get the word vectors for each word.
   - Here's an example using your tokenized words:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

# Initialize Word2Vec model
word2vec_model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_words, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)

# Get the word vectors
word_vectors = word2vec_model.wv

# Print the word vectors
print("\nWord Embeddings (Word2Vec):")
for word in word_vectors.index_to_key:
    print(f"{word}: {word_vectors[word]}")
```

Remember to replace the example tokenized words with your actual data. These techniques will help you represent your words in a format suitable for machine learning tasks! üöÄüìä





Certainly! Let's walk through how to use N-grams for feature extraction and vectorization in Python based on your lemmatized token list, `tokenized_words`:

1. **N-grams**:
   - N-grams are contiguous sequences of **n** items (usually words) from a given text.
   - For example:
     - **Unigrams (1-grams)**: Single words (e.g., "cat," "chase," "mouse").
     - **Bigrams (2-grams)**: Pairs of adjacent words (e.g., "cat chase," "chase mouse").
     - **Trigrams (3-grams)**: Triplets of adjacent words (e.g., "cat chase mouse").

2. **Count Vectorization with N-grams**:
   - We'll use the `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn to create a matrix of word frequencies (counts) based on N-grams.
   - Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Example lemmatized token list (replace with your actual lemmatized tokens)
tokenized_words = [
    "cat chase mouse",
    "dog bark tree",
    "bird fly sky"
]

# Initialize the CountVectorizer with n-grams (e.g., bigrams)
ngram_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))  # You can adjust the n-gram range

# Fit and transform the lemmatized tokens
ngram_matrix = ngram_vectorizer.fit_transform(tokenized_words)

# Get the feature names (words or n-grams)
feature_names = ngram_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Print the n-gram matrix and feature names
print("N-gram Matrix:")
print(ngram_matrix.toarray())
print("\nFeature Names:")
print(feature_names)
```

3. **Explanation**:
   - In the resulting matrix, each row corresponds to a document (sentence), and each column represents a word or an N-gram.
   - The cell values indicate the frequency of each word or N-gram in the corresponding document.

4. **Example Output**:
   ```
   N-gram Matrix:
   [[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0]]

   Feature Names:
   ['bark' 'bark tree' 'bird' 'bird fly' 'cat' 'cat chase' 'chase'
    'chase mouse' 'dog' 'dog bark' 'fly' 'fly sky' 'mouse' 'sky' 'tree']
   ```

Remember to replace the example tokenized words with your actual data. This approach will help you create a feature matrix based on N-grams for your machine learning tasks! üöÄüìä





Certainly! Let's explore how to combine **N-grams**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, and **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)** for feature extraction and vectorization in Python:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization with N-grams**:
   - We'll use the `TfidfVectorizer` from scikit-learn to create a matrix of TF-IDF scores based on N-grams.
   - Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Example lemmatized token list (replace with your actual lemmatized tokens)
tokenized_words = [
    "cat chase mouse",
    "dog bark tree",
    "bird fly sky"
]

# Initialize the TF-IDF vectorizer with n-grams (e.g., bigrams)
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))  # You can adjust the n-gram range

# Fit and transform the lemmatized tokens using TF-IDF
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(tokenized_words)

# Get the feature names (words or n-grams)
tfidf_feature_names = tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Print the TF-IDF matrix and feature names
print("TF-IDF Matrix:")
print(tfidf_matrix.toarray())
print("\nTF-IDF Feature Names:")
print(tfidf_feature_names)
```

2. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)**:
   - We'll continue using the same Word2Vec model initialized earlier.
   - Get the word vectors for each word (lemmatized token).
   - Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Initialize Word2Vec model (assuming it's already initialized)
word_vectors = word2vec_model.wv

# Print the word vectors
print("\nWord Embeddings (Word2Vec):")
for word in word_vectors.index_to_key:
    print(f"{word}: {word_vectors[word]}")
```

3. **Explanation**:
   - In the TF-IDF matrix, each row corresponds to a document (sentence), and each column represents a word or an N-gram. The cell values indicate the TF-IDF scores.
   - The Word2Vec model provides dense vector representations for each word (lemmatized token).

Remember to replace the example tokenized words with your actual data. These techniques will help you create feature vectors combining N-grams, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings for your NLP tasks! üöÄüìä

Certainly! To lemmatize a list of pos-tagged tokens in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the WordNet Lemmatizer**:
   - We'll use the WordNet Lemmatizer from the NLTK library.

2. **Map POS Tags to WordNet POS Tags**:
   - The WordNet Lemmatizer requires WordNet POS tags (e.g., 'n' for nouns, 'v' for verbs, 'a' for adjectives, 'r' for adverbs).
   - You'll need to map the POS tags from your input to the corresponding WordNet POS tags.

3. **Lemmatize Each Token**:
   - Apply the lemmatization process to each token using the mapped WordNet POS tag.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Example pos-tagged token list (replace with your actual pos-tagged tokens)
pos_tagged = [
    ("cat", "NN"),
    ("chase", "VB"),
    ("mouse", "NN"),
    ("dogs", "NNS"),
    ("barking", "VBG")
]

# Initialize WordNet Lemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

# Lemmatize each token based on its POS tag
lemmatized_tokens = []
for token, pos in pos_tagged:
    # Map POS tags to WordNet POS tags
    wordnet_pos = nltk.corpus.reader.wordnet.NOUN
    if pos.startswith("V"):
        wordnet_pos = nltk.corpus.reader.wordnet.VERB
    elif pos.startswith("J"):
        wordnet_pos = nltk.corpus.reader.wordnet.ADJ
    elif pos.startswith("R"):
        wordnet_pos = nltk.corpus.reader.wordnet.ADV
    # Lemmatize the token
    lemma = lemmatizer.lemmatize(token, pos=wordnet_pos)
    lemmatized_tokens.append(lemma)

# Print the lemmatized tokens
print("Lemmatized Tokens:")
print(lemmatized_tokens)
```

In this example, we've lemmatized the tokens based on their POS tags. Adjust the code according to your specific token list. Happy lemmatizing! üåüüìù



Certainly! Let's break down the process of reading your tab-separated text file into Python, processing it, and performing the train-test split:

1. **Reading the Data**:
   - You can use the `csv` module to read the tab-separated file and extract the data into lists.
   - Assuming your file is named `your_file.txt`, here's how you can read it:

```python
import csv

# Initialize empty lists for each column
sentiment_labels = []
products = []
reviews = []

# Read the tab-separated file
with open('your_file.txt', 'r') as tsv_file:
    tsv_reader = csv.reader(tsv_file, delimiter='\t')  # Specify tab as the delimiter
    next(tsv_reader)  # Skip the header row
    for row in tsv_reader:
        sentiment_labels.append(row[0])
        products.append(row[1])
        reviews.append(row[2])

# Print a few rows to verify
print("Sentiment Labels:", sentiment_labels[:5])
print("Products:", products[:5])
print("Reviews:", reviews[:5])
```

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Once you have your data in lists, proceed with the train-test split.
   - You can use libraries like `scikit-learn` to split your data into training and testing subsets.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - After the split, you can build your machine learning model using the training data.
   - Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.) based on your task (sentiment analysis).

4. **Evaluate and Predict**:
   - Evaluate your model's performance using the testing data.
   - Use the trained model to predict sentiment labels for new reviews.

Remember to replace `'your_file.txt'` with the actual path to your tab-separated file. Good luck with your sentiment analysis task! üöÄüìä
